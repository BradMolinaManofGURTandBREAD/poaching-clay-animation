	  <h3>Storyboard, Character, Set, and Mechanical Design</h3>
	  	<p> For this project I helped with every scene in the storyboard by creating the background set, furniture, and a house. I helped with the filming by changing the sets according to the storyboard and holding them steady while the pictures were taken for every frame. More specifically I created the poachers house, the sky, the grass, the bed, the fridge, and the milk carton.</p>
